        This week we started using tinkercad. I already know everything about using tinkercad, the tools, shortcuts, etc. First we went over brainstorming what to do and the basic controls. Afterwards, we were tasked with making a Rube Goldberg machine with the five simple machines. Thursday was challenge day and because it was so hot we did a modeling activity inside. My friend, Riley, was chosen as one of the judges and everyone was given a time limit of 30 minutes to create a home appliance, the most accurate one won a bandaid signed by Mr. Poole or a kitkat. I was really confident with my design but my friend chose a very simple looking couch, he refuses to tell me why he did it even though my toaster had emmence amount of detail.
