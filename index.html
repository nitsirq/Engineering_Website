        This week we started using tinkercad. I already know everything about using tinkercad, the tools, shortcuts, etc. First we went over brainstorming what to do and the basic controls. Afterwards, we were tasked with making a Rube Goldberg machine with the five simple machines. Thursday was challenge day and because it was so hot we did a modeling activity inside. My friend, Riley, was chosen as one of the judges and everyone was given a time limit of 30 minutes to create a home appliance, the most accurate one won a bandaid signed by Mr. Poole or a kitkat. I was really confident with my design but my friend chose a very simple looking couch, he refuses to tell me why he did it even though my toaster had emmence amount of detail.

        On tuesday we started a personal Rube Goldberg machine using the 6 six basic machines. I tried including all of the machines but could not due to not being able to make a wedge to seperate something and a screw, even though the needle technically counts as a wedge. We continued to work on our Rube Goldberg machine on wednesday and on Thrusday we went into groups to make a Rube Goldberg machine. We all had to add a part of our personal Rube Goldberg machine to the group one.

        This week we started cutting out our Rube Goldberg machine that we were planning. It went alright, but some of our group members were slightly off task. This went on for three days and on Thursday it was challenge day. On challenge day we had to contruct a boat out of paper that would be able to hold weight and last 5 minutes.
