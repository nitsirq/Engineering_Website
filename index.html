        This week we started using tinkercad. I already know everything about using tinkercad, the tools, shortcuts, etc. First we went over brainstorming what to do and the basic controls. Afterwards, we were tasked with making a Rube Goldberg machine with the five simple machines. Thursday was challenge day and because it was so hot we did a modeling activity inside. My friend, Riley, was chosen as one of the judges and everyone was given a time limit of 30 minutes to create a home appliance, the most accurate one won a bandaid signed by Mr. Poole or a kitkat. I was really confident with my design but my friend chose a very simple looking couch, he refuses to tell me why he did it even though my toaster had emmence amount of detail.

        On tuesday we started a personal Rube Goldberg machine using the 6 six basic machines. I tried including all of the machines but could not due to not being able to make a wedge to seperate something and a screw, even though the needle technically counts as a wedge. We continued to work on our Rube Goldberg machine on wednesday and on Thrusday we went into groups to make a Rube Goldberg machine. We all had to add a part of our personal Rube Goldberg machine to the group one.

        This week we started cutting out our Rube Goldberg machine that we were planning. It went alright, but some of our group members were slightly off task. This went othe n for three days and on Thursday it was challenge day. On challenge day we had to contruct a boat out of paper that would be able to hold weight and last 5 minutes. More information on the <a href="PaperBoat.pdf">PDF</a>.

        The Rube Goldberg machine was finished this week, but one of our team members, Cristian, transferred into lacrosse so he wasn't able to to see it in action on presenting day. We tested it many times to make sure it worked and it worked almost every single time. Our group had finished first and after we started helping some other groups. On presenting day we were the first group to present. When it came to the needle popping the balloon, it didn't penetrate due to the balloon not being inflated to it's fullest. On the second run it did pop though. Heres the video of the Rube Goldberg machine with and without a balloon.

        Mr. Poole caught covid and was out all week and we didn't do that much work. Monday through Friday we had to create and improve our bioengineering prosthetic. My prosthetic is for Capybaras and it replaces either the front two legs or the hind legs. It utilizes wheels for and the prosthetic can be adusted for any animal.

        This week was pretty exciting. We got to take apart a laptop and analyze the components and label them on a diagram. I knew almost all of the components before taking apart the computer because a few days before hand I had to take apart my laptop in order to fix a port. My partner, Elio, and I had taken apart the computer without any problems and managed to finish on the first day. On the third day, Mr. Poole's Wifi and power had gone out due to the fuse being set off. So on Thursday, our challenge was to convince Mr. Poole that there are more doors than wheels in Crescenta Valley. Since Elio had to go soon, I was partnered with my good friend Riley and we counted that there was around 6000 doors. We thought that doors could be counted as lockers, windows, normal doors, elavator doors, cabinets, drawers, and etc. Overall this week was pretty fun, other than the fact that Mr. Poole had lost power in his room.

        The entirety of this week we had to stay in a different room because the electricity hadn't been fixed. Other than that we started our aerospace engineering unit. For this unit we learned the four variables of flying, lift, drag, weight, and thrust. Using our knowledge we have to design a bottle rocket that has to go through the football goal and land as close as possible into a bin. Everybody was put into random groups of 3 which we have to work with in designing our plane. We all contributed good ideas and made plans for the rocket. On challenge day we had to design a paper airplane that had to land into a bin at the bottom of the stairs. No one managed to make it into the bin due to the strong winds pushing the planes away.

        This week the transformer was fixed and we were able to return to Mr. Pooles room. In our groups we had to build the rocket that we had designed using cad. Instead of using cardboard for wings we thought that using paper and sticks as the frame would be better for flying. We were building it for the entire week and everything we going well until our seals kept failing and on friday I came early to school in order to seal the rocket, but it didn't work so I started with a new bottle and taped on the other rockets wings which I had broken off. When we were launching everyone's rocket didn't go quite as to plan. They kept doing loops in the air and nose diving, which my groups did. It was quite tragic, but there was one good run that had stayed into the air for like 4 seconds. <a href="BOM.pdf">BOM</a> and <a href="Worksheet.pdf">Worksheet</a>

        This week we learned about environmental engineering. Environmental engineers solve problems revolving around the environment with the use of engineering. We were put in groups of 3 and our objective was to make a water filter using cotton, rocks and sand. It somewhat worked, if we had put it through our filter a few more times it probably could've come out clear. Another thing that happened this week was that Mr. Poole gave out a quiz based on the slides, it was only proving a point that hands on learning is more rememborable than memorizing and taking tests.

        Halloween just happened. This year I was a banana, my adult sized costume finally fits too. The topic for this week was electrical engineering. We learned about Ohms law and the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. Using tinkercad we simulated a breadboard and applied the formula we learned in order to calculate the ammount of resistance a 20mA LED needs from a 9V battery. The lab was very informative and now I have a better understanding in electrical engineering.

        Electrical engineering! This week we started the electrical engineering unit! The previous week we learned how a breadboard works, which I found was very interesting. It was a lot simplier than I had originally imagined. Using what we learned last week we made the circuits in real life. Using an arduino connected to our laptops in order to limit the amount of voltage to 3.3 V and 5 V. All of the circuits worked and it was very fun. On challenge day we tried convincing Mr. Poole that taking a math class for an entire year is better than writing 1 to 1 million. <a href="challenge.pdf">Challenge PDF</a>

        This week we programmed the arduino. Instead of using the arduino as just a power supply we programmed and uploaded to the arduino in order to control the pin output. Coding the arduino was a very simple and pretty interesting to do. On challenge day we had to propse solutions to the carcinagen in a lake, <a href="carcinogenlake.pdf">PDF</a> to challenge. This Thanksgiving break I'm going to be coding and spending time with my dad. I'm going to celebrate Thanksgiving day at church like I do every year. My favorite part is the candied yams, which are yams that have toasted marshmellows covering them.
